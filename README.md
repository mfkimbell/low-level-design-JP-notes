## Java vs Python: Calling Superclass Methods

#### Java Example
```java
class Food {
    public String getFood() {
        return "Sandwich";
    }
}

class PackagedFood extends Food {
    @Override
    public String getFood() {
        return super.getFood() + " in a bag";
    }
}
```

#### Python Example
```python
class Food:
    def get_food(self) -> str:
        return "Sandwich"

class PackagedFood(Food):
    def get_food(self) -> str:
        return super().get_food() + " in a bag"
```

### Python Constructor Initialization
```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Base constructor called")

class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Calls the constructor of Base class
        print("Derived constructor called")
```

#### Summary
- **Java**: Use `super.methodName()` to call superclass methods; `super()` for constructors.
- **Python**: Use `super().method_name()` to call superclass methods or `super().__init__()` for constructors.

## Summary
- **Java**: Use `this` to refer to instance variables and methods. Use `super()` to call superclass constructors. Private variables are commonly used to enforce encapsulation.
- **Python**: Use `self` to refer to instance variables and methods. Use `super()` to call superclass methods or constructors.

#### Constructor and Method Example Java
```java
class Person {
    private String name;  // Private variable declaration
    private int age;  // Another instance variable to differentiate

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;  // Use `this` to refer to the instance variable
        this.age = age;    // Use `this` to refer to the instance variable
    }

    public void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + ", Age: " + this.age);  // Use `this` to refer to instance variables
    }
}

```
#### Constructor and Method Example Python
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name  # Use `self` to refer to the instance variable
        self.age = age    # Another instance variable to differentiate

    def print_details(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")  # Use `self` to refer to instance variables
```

# Python

The single underscore (_) before a variable name (like self._rows and self._columns) is a Python convention that indicates the variable is intended to be private or protected and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

Same goes for methods if i did `_initGrid()` that might indicate that the method should not be called from outside the class, which enforces that it should be used only as part of the classâ€™s internal setup. Because it's public, we might initialized the grid at anytime from another method. 

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, columns):
        self._rows = rows
        self._columns = columns
        self._grid = [[GridPosition.EMPTY for _ in range(columns)] for _ in range(rows)]
        self.initGrid()
```
